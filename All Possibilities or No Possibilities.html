        <p>Timing Matters Experience: This experience happened to me, Tempest, and a large part of it was due to a lack of understanding of my perspective when it came to what I care about most - money or time?</p>

        <p>Our online hiring system is limited with the timing of applying, interviewing, and landing a job. This has caused me to know the difference between those who couldn't care less about whether I live or die. I understand there are so many possibilities to have a job so homelessness is not where one ends up finding themselves. </p>
            
        <p>There are many options available for asssitance when times get tough, but what many don't consider is when someone's mind does not see all possibilities within an experience given a circumstance (key word here) - when someone doesn't see all these options, and instead, sees none. For me, I decided to stop vices for a while (addictions/co-dependencies) and at that time is when everything fell apart. I learned how much timing is such an important reason why anything works out for anyone and even the smallest changes in timing can make a huge difference in the outcome of one's future - people underestimate this within our online systems. Getting a job and being able to work it is dependent on the timing and limitations of these systems, whether it is with the jobs themselves or the assistance until the job is secured. </p>
            
        <p>This experience got to a point where people who I thought would help my animals and I didn't help, and people who I was most scared about asking for help did (strangers/different family) long enough for me to change the outcome of my life. The people who I thought cared about me "getting a job" and didn't were the least helpful because they didn't understand what my circumstance was and didn't care to ask about it. As a side note, I understand being on speaking terms is a large factor in when people trust one another, but the reasons why people are not on speaking terms is a huge factor in who has not cared and who has (it is the difference between who can maintain boundaries and who cannot). </p>
            
        <p>I believe these people I thought would help during this time never truly cared about me "getting a job", they didn't really care about me they way I cared about them - I would have been there for them if the circumstance was flipped. All of them. This experience led to me nearly losing my life in a hurriane with my animals. The stupidest part is if I had support to think about my options at that time, the lack of money was not the reason for being in my situation, it was the lack of time to do what I needed to do to turn things around, i.e., apply for unemployment in a safe environment. I am thankful those that were there for my animals and I during that time and attruibute God as a reason for the timing to work out, even though it was different then expected. </p>
        
        <p>Word of advice, do not risk uprooting your life in efforts to care about loved ones safety without preparing for it. If you believe you cannot prepare for it, then seek out help from family first so you can plan things out. You do not want to be in a situation I was in where the people you are trying to help would leave you stranded if things go south and the system doesn't accommodate what you need because of your specific circumstance. This is one of many things that stood out - the unemployment system literally would NOT work until I was in a safe spot, then the timing worked all of a sudden when my environment was changed. More details may be shared in the future for clarity, but it is still something I am working through. There is a major difference in understanding why my actions led to a bad sitation and understanding it too late, compared to asking for help from people and they are careless because they don't or haven't related. </p>
        
        <p>Maybe that is another thing for me to take away for this. If people don't relate to your experience, they won't care to help. I believe different in that regard but this is how many people navigate their lives nowadays. If it feels like you may not be in a safe situation in the future given what is currently happening, make your safety the priority, not others.</p>
