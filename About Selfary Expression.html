        <p>I created Selfary Expression as a way for adults to explore their self-expression. Everything on the website was thought out in a certain way to consider both the child aspects of ourselves along with the adult. I understand that there are those who may look at the website and wonder, what is this business about?</p>

        <p>This is typically in response to the different parts that are included in the business, as I didn't care for the "normal" way to do business, which are: Method number one, add all the products (or services) possible on a website and see what sticks and what doesn't and then add a bunch more of what sticks (includes little no care about the products - or services - and what they do to others). Method number two, be really focused on one thing to the point that it shows you care more than anybody else about that one thing (like selling wood only and knowing everything there is to know about wood).</p>

        <p>I believe that with all businesses, there is a lack of balance of the different parts of ourselves. We have something we all know very well and/or that we enjoy sharing with others, etc., but we often let go of the fun in life or the humanity in our choices. To be frank, many businesses to me seem very robotic, and that makes sense because of AI, but even before this big AI bang, so to speak. It is like people care more about doing as little work possible, or care more about being "the best" at something, that they lose sight of inspiring others and caring about other people's experiences.</p>

        <p>I do understand that not all businesses are like this. I believe small businesses have so much more potential than the large corporations personally, and it is more often than not because there is community and caring about one another. The CEO of a large corporation does not have enough time to care about millions of products and customers. A CEO of a small business can.</p>

        <p>With that being said, here are a few reasons for the different sections of the business to give insight for those curious.</p>

        <p>Educational: This goes hand-in-hand with the parts of us that we enjoy sharing to others, even if others don't care, we care anyway because we will eventually find the ones that do. It is a large part of our purpose and even if we aren't good at everything that the purpose requires, we keep going and don't give up.</p>

        <p>For me, inspirating and educating others about the topics learned in school has been important because I see the value in the knowledge, but it's a bummer that so many schools suck at organization or care more about their profit, and so they suck in general because of that.</p>

        <p>Adult Experience: I believe that there are too many curiosities with our sexual interests that many ignore because of what others think about them. I have been there. The reason that the bondage scene is the primary fantasy/kink of focus on here is because it is the one that ties (punny) into all other kinks/fantasies, even if is subtle and hardly noticeable.</p>

        <p>How so? Consent. That is connected to bondage and submission in terms of authority and control. I want to be one of the businesses that shift this mindset of authority and control to trust and vulnerability, as that is lacking in this scene greatly. The willingness to trust your pleasure to another is automatically vulnerable, no matter what turns you on.</p>

        <p>I keep the items not so vulgar, at least, as much as they could be also. I don't include insertion and vibration items because the sense of touch matters greatly in trust and vulnerability, whether we are talking about with hands or our downstairs parts. I want customers who are interested in exploring themselves in a safe way, not customers who care more about tying someone up because they want to finally get what they want from someone else. Do not be shady when shopping on Selfary Expression, and if you are thinking about being shady, do your shopping elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Safety is a priority. Many items in this section consider the young adult or beginner in bondage or sex in general. The more we express this part of ourselves, the more we understand what causes us pleasure in a way that doesn't interfere with other people's free will - it's more about connection and less about control. It does not have to be shameful to pleasure ourselves or others, and if you currently believe it is, it may be worth considering, who or what caused you to believe that? Are you believing your beliefs or someone else's? Have you been doing unethical actions of pleasure?</p>

        <p>Inner Child: Having fun with our hobbies and the creative parts of us matters GREATLY. This allows for us to see different perspectives of our skills and our pleasure because of the peace it brings. Our mind needs time to think and that happens effortlessly when it isn't thinking about other stuff. If you have a hard time with having or keeping hobbies, or don't care about them at all because you are "too busy", I want to be the one to assure you that nothing in this world is so important that you can't make time for peaceful experiences.</p>

        <p>I only add items that are ones that connect to my experiences of what I enjoy doing for peaceful times. If you have a hobby you are thinking about trying out, but you don't see the items on Selfary Expression, then I encourage you to dive by the craft, sports, or toy section on your next shopping trip and maybe give those peaceful experiences a try.</p>

        <p>Peace be with you.</p>
