        <!-- Article Text -->
        <p>Here's a belief to consider: Everyone in the world is currently addicted to something.</p>

        <p>I should offer a sort of disclaimer with this article. This goal of awareness of oneself and working on not doing actions to avoid yourself, that is a work in progress throughout your entire life. Especially considering we are surrounded by addiction EVERYWHERE – spending money alone could be a form of addiction if it has caused you hardship by not saving. If you see improvement in your actions of addiction, i.e., doing it less often, not partaking as much, or maybe you notice that the shift from addiction to co-dependence has occurred, then that is what matters. That is what means something. Don’t be too hard on yourself, but keep this in mind as something to work on if you felt this article connected a little too close to home.</p>

        <p>Makes one wonder about the connection between this belief and the limitation in our free will. At least it makes me wonder. My reasoning is: Does the addictions we have cause the limitation in possibilities around us?</p>

        <p>I understand the why when it comes to believing in this belief. The state of the world, or our family life because of the state of the world, is a main reason for needing to put negative thoughts and feelings to the side and have a sense of peace or pleasure. This creates the main cause of avoidance, though this article is more focused on a different point of view of what people are addicted to.</p>

        <p>Contrary to popular belief that the item of the addiction itself is the culprit, the issue isn’t with the substance or the thing itself, like drugs, coffee, or food. It is with doing the action associated with the substance or thing itself when shitty circumstances are happening in the moment.</p>

        <p>The jest of it comes down to why. Why do people drink? Or keep taking all sorts of pills? Or why can’t you put down that doughnut and grab a salad instead?</p>

        <p>Understanding your thoughts and feelings about the action being connected to past and current experience gives you the why the addiction is happening to begin with.</p>

        <p>We all have times that suck at some point in our lives, but if your crutch to get through those times is to avoid the anxiety or depression (mental anguish or pain) by believing that something external is going to take that anxiety or depression away, then you are losing the belief in your free will. In order to not lose site of your free will, it is important to learn how to handle pain and mental anguish in a way that requires you to do actions that have a meaning associated with them as I believe this is safe (or healing) for me, instead of I believe this is the only way I can keep living. Be transparent with yourself. Addiction can easily do that to your mind or heart to get what it wants in the moment, but those thoughts or feelings eventually catch up to everyone. It is my personal belief that the leading cause of death in the world is addiction.</p>

        <p>True addiction is when someone doesn’t realize how much their actions are causing their life to be the way it is and bitches about it being that way without taking action to do anything about it. Addicts believe that their actions aren’t the cause of the addiction and will do whatever it takes to think or feel good by having the thing they are addicted to.</p>

        <p>Even if you don’t believe my belief about addiction and death at this time, the reason that addiction is at the very least a problem, regardless if it is something like drugs, which is commonly associated with death, or coffee, which is commonly associated with being healthy for you, is because it is of avoidance of ourselves.</p>

        <p>Wham! Something happens suddenly in the current moment that causes a terrible or traumatic experience, and it is mainly because it was decided that the addiction was more important than understanding and learning about oneself. More or less, “I didn’t think that could happen to me” events occur.</p>

        <p>When quitting an addiction, anything that seems like is falling apart comes from the avoidance of thoughts and feelings throughout your entire past. You will always be addicted to whatever is in question until you decide experiences of being addicted to the thing are worse than doing the action itself. That makes sense. That’s why drug addicts eventually stop using meth or heroin – it destroys their body and mind, kills someone they love, or nearly kills themselves. My thinking is taking that one step further, where any addiction can destroy your body or mind to the point that life and death is in question, because of experience alone.</p>

        <p>If you are addicted to coffee for instance, coffee could one day kill you since your mind places that thing as having “the most” meaning in your life – you prioritize that when you could prioritize other things. Eventually if you haven’t become aware of it yet, an experience will show you what your prioritization habits are when it comes to addiction and other things that matter to you in your life. With the coffee example, while it is less likely you would know that coffee is to blame for shitty prioritization because there is information out there that says coffee is healthy, you’re fine, an experience can show you that your coffee addiction is the cause of your avoidance of yourself, but since it is shrugged off, your mind decides to blame something or someone else for a shitty experience gone wrong, yet your coffee “needs” are another possible blame as to why that experience went wrong.</p>

        <p>Accountability is acknowledging when one’s actions are a cause for an experience occurring, and blame is the focus of other people’s actions, instead of one’s own. While “blame” does matter for the sake of making sure other people do not limit our free will – I prefer truth because it adds in understanding the meaning behind timing of actions and intention – focusing only on other people’s actions instead of your own tells others who notice that you believe people blame you for their actions.</p>

        <p>I do believe people can enjoy the actions they were once addicted to if they acknowledge their behaviors during the times they did those actions and understand what needs to be different, as there is another side to addiction too. Being afraid to do actions that were attributed to an addiction because of not having enough willpower to handle when to not do those actions. That is a double-edged sword because many people quit one addiction only to replace it with another. Also, if you quit something you were addicted to because it was going to kill you otherwise, it is wise to be sure your mind isn’t afraid of the thing itself, and more so understanding that you do not want that thing in your life anymore. Simply put, there is a difference between fear as a reason to not do an addiction and knowing when that thing is not for you anymore because of x, y, and z. If there is still temptation to do the addiction when not doing it, then from personal experience, you may have some work in the fear department.</p>

        <p>All in all, addiction is a fickle bitch, and it takes ongoing work. It is not for the faint of heart. But the main reason to consider the path of working through the addiction is for peace of mind - so you can experience life itself and not keep your pleasure contained to the items you ingest or the actions you take. </p>
