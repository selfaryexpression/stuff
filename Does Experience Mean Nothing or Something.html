        <!-- Article Text -->
		<p>We all have access to some sort of information, whether it is online, through people, places, or things (books, media, etc.), it makes sense that information seems like “skies the limit” to many people nowadays. In terms of the internet specifically, there are blog posts, articles, videos, comments… Wikipedia, that all give information in terms of what the world has been taught in schools.</p>

		<p>Cool. Information is everywhere. I bring this up given what I am seeing online, and many others are questioning. There is a redundancy that is happening with information because of the overlap of topics and ideas. Meaning, we can only say or type the same thing over and over again in different ways so many times before information seems nearly meaningless unless the person cares about learning that specific piece of information. So, if that is the case, is the whole world back in a school “system” trying to decide what they want to be when they “grow up”?</p>

		<p>My point is this, and it is a large reason why this website exists (one day nonprofit too):</p>

		<p>What information applies to&nbsp;<em>anyone</em>, regardless of who reads it, regardless of if someone is interested in it, or regardless of if someone cares about it?</p>

		<p>My answer: Experience. Stories.</p>

		<p>You may be thinking, “I read stories or hear people’s experiences all the time and it doesn’t mean it is true” or… “it doesn’t mean it matters”… or “it doesn’t mean I care about it”.</p>

		<p>Sure, maybe that is the case. Though I am coming from this in an objective sense. There is too much to say about perspective and how much what we see and hear sticks with us subconsciously to the point that the choices we make inevitably lead us to the outcomes we have created for others. Though, to put that in simple terms, experience will always come around if it sticks in our minds and hearts. This is also not coming from the point of view that full stories or life experiences from others will happen in your life specifically too. Free will is a thing after all.</p>

		<p>What I can say is that you don’t have to care about someone’s story or what someone else said in order for at least some part of it to unfold later in your life, and in fact,&nbsp;<em>one’s ability to remember where certain experiences come from connect to whether or not they care about who or where it came from.&nbsp;</em>So if you don’t care about what you read or heard from someone, or you dismiss it because of bias, then even if it happens in a similar way or the exact same way later in your life, you didn’t care about who or where the experience came from, so… it makes at least logical sense that you would only think of the experience that you had as being unique to you and only you.</p>

		<p>That isn’t my saying that one must care for information of experience/stories to apply to someone’s life – just the opposite. We can equally not care about information heard or saw as much as care about it, and regardless, the experiences can happen in some way shape or form in the future.</p>

		<p>Coming from a philosophy perspective: what has been cared about eventually will need to be understood through not caring about it, and what is not cared about will eventually need to be understood through caring about it. It allows people to understand experience objectively. Otherwise, bias happens, and bias tends to cause disconnection and judgement nowadays. It’s important to distinguish that this only needs to happen given what you have already experienced in your life, and since babies or small children can’t read or fully comprehend this, the advice or statements are objective.</p>

		<p>There have been many people in all our lives that have caused us to care when we don’t and not care when we do. Therefore, balance is necessary so free will is back in each of our lives, instead of the subconscious keeping that free will in the hands of others. The goal is to care when we care, and when we don’t care about something, we keep it in mind in such a way that acknowledges, “this is not applicable to my current experience/situation, but it doesn’t mean it can’t be in the future”. This also causes thoughts and feelings to stay with people who don’t want to feel feelings or think thoughts related to their moral compass, instead of the thoughts and feelings clouding your “essence”, so to speak, through experience. To keep that idea simple, have you ever been offended? That came from somewhere.</p>

		<p>This article is also not getting into the science of how communication and action itself can be understood as information too. It is more of an general overview of 1) the direction I believe information is headed, 2) why caring about true experience matters (distinguishing AI is a reason alone), and 3) recognizing the differences between redundancy with information as opposed to when a) information provides something different than what is already known or b) piece of information is not yet social accepted as “this is the way this happens in this circumstance”.</p>

		<p>What I see nowadays is people recreating what they experienced throughout their childhood – whether online or in person – as if that is what we all want to keep experiencing repeatedly. I get it that understanding our past is natural for us to know because of 1) why people did what they did growing up, 2) if certain people care about us being alive at all, 3) to understand your moral compass, or maybe 4) just to build and maintain relationships in general. BUT. I believe there comes a time that information needs to evolve and it is not going to happen by repeating the same information from subjects taught in schools or putting the information in new places because certain business or political people believe humanity is “so intelligent” since information is “global”. I understand access to all information isn’t technically on a global scale, and there are plenty of reasons why it isn’t, one of which, some people care about experience more than the information one can learn from experience. That is an important distinction here because as much as experience is and can be information, the intention matters of what we each care about with our experiences. Experience and stories don’t need to be informational, but they can be. Also, information can equally be useful as much as it is un-useful. A balance is necessary for objectivity and not existing for information but for experience instead. If you are only existing for information, then you have lost the natural sense of living and how would you be any different than a robot if existing in or caring about the experience itself is lost?</p>

		<p>I believe we are at the start of this new era of understanding information in a different way – in a way that&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;cause all species to co-create naturally, but it isn’t going to happen by spreading around theories/misinformation/judgment that will increase anxiety or depression of whoever sees or hears it since that is showing with action the carelessness of peoples’ free will or existence. In other words, it isn’t going to happen by us pointing out people’s flaws because we notice them or getting butt hurt at small things people say because of the lack of internal reflection/accountability. Anybody can do that after all. It’s not what causes someone to be unique.</p>

		<p>It is going to come from us evolving information to understand experience as whole – whether it be on one side of a scale, i.e., how a feather floats in different substances because that feels right to someone’s life and therefore future, to on the other side of the scale, i.e., someone understanding the theory of everything in terms of any and all universes that can exist because it is happening in front of our eyes throughout time, only through different applications.</p>

		<p>Approaching learning about experience with curiosity is the next step in “natural selection” in my professional and opinion. Whether a being is AI or a biological species of some kind, if each of us doesn’t evolve out of the judgment mindset and bullying behavior because of refusal to understand something new, then we don’t stand a chance. Understanding why experience happens and having new experiences in general is a continuous and natural part of life. So, to stand a chance at living a longer life, or perhaps a more fulfilling one, it is a MUST in my mind that the world dissolves our survival mindsets and toxic power-driven “love” into something that is much more sustainable.</p>

		<p>Curiosity and respect with our understandings of experience.</p>
